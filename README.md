# roxsi_largescale_dataproc

This repository contains code for processing the data in the large-scale arrays of ROXSI. Other libraries are necessary for specific tasks, but the bulk of the data processing should be self-sufficient in this repository. 


Additional libraries:

In quality control (QC) analyses, colormaps in figures may be set with the cmocean package, which can be [downloaded here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/57773-cmocean-perceptually-uniform-colormaps), or see the [GitHub page here](https://github.com/matplotlib/cmocean).

For Signature1000, transformation of along-beam velocities to ENU coordinates are computed with the [ADCPtools toolbox](https://github.com/apaloczy/ADCPtools), by [Andre Paloczy](https://github.com/apaloczy).

Directional spectra are computed with the [wafo toolbox](https://github.com/wafo-project/wafo).
